Story: Christmas Carol
===============

It's Christmas Eve in Thistle Gulch. The town is depressed and the people are poor, but Reverend Blackwood wants 
to change that. He's planning a Christmas Carol for the town, but he needs to gather some people to help him.
He's looking for a few good people to help him spread some Christmas cheer, or so he says.
Sarah Brown has wearily agreed to help by convincing others in town to join the Carol. She's not sure if it
will work, given the town's mood, but she's willing to try.

Each character (blackwood or brown) has a different set of skills that they can use. First the two characters will
discuss who to recruit and which one of them will do the recruiting. Then they will go out and try to recruit the
people they've decided on. They will use their skills to try to convince the people to join the Carol. Each
person they try to convince will state whether they will join or not. If they join, they will return to their
normal activities until the Carol starts at 6pm. They will not offer to recruit anyone else. Characters can and
should refuse to join the Carol if they are busy or if it's out of character.

At 6pm, the Carol will start. The goal is to have as many people as possible join the Carol. The more people that
join, the more successful the Carol will be. The Carol will last for 1 hour, and then the story will end.
