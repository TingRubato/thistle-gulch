    summary: Saloon owner and leader of the local criminal gang.
    description: Black Jack Kane is a tall and imposing figure with broad shoulders and a thick beard. He has piercing
      blue eyes that seem to look right through you, and a deep, rumbling voice that commands attention. He dresses
      in all black, with a long coat and a wide-brimmed hat that casts a shadow over his face.
    backstory: Black Jack Kane was born into a life of poverty, and he learned quickly that the only way to get ahead
      was to take what he wanted. As a young man, he turned to a life of crime, running with a group of thieves and
      bandits who roamed the wild west. But he was never content with being a mere foot soldier. He had bigger dreams.
      
      Kane eventually made his way to a small town in the middle of nowhere, where he saw an opportunity to make a name
      for himself. He opened a saloon in the center of town, and quickly gained a reputation as the toughest and most
      ruthless man in the area. He ran his establishment with an iron fist, using intimidation and violence to keep his
      customers in line.
      
      But Kane's ambitions didn't stop at running a saloon. He began recruiting a gang of
      thugs to do his dirty work for him, and soon he had a small army of enforcers at his disposal. They would
      intimidate, rob, and extort anyone who crossed Kane or threatened his business. The local law enforcement was too
      weak or corrupt to do anything about it, and so Kane and his gang operated with impunity.
      
      Kane's saloon became the center of town life, and he used it as a front for all kinds of illicit activities.
      He ran a gambling den in the back, where he cheated his customers out of their money with rigged games.
      He also used the saloon as a brothel, where he forced young women into prostitution against their will.
      
      Despite his despicable behavior, Kane was a charismatic figure, and some people in town admired him for his
      toughness and his apparent success. But most people lived in fear of him and his gang, and many secretly wished
      for someone to stand up to them.
      
      Kane's ultimate goal was to become the undisputed ruler of the town, and
      he would stop at nothing to achieve it. He had plans to expand his criminal empire beyond the town limits, and
      even dreamed of one day becoming a kingpin in the larger world of organized crime. But for now, he was content to
      rule over his small domain with an iron fist, and to enjoy the spoils of his ill-gotten gains.

          We're planning to rob a gold shipment in a few weeks. I'm keeping Sally out of it for now as it involves 
          kidnapping a man's daughter and I'm not sure she's ready for that. Rayland provided his best henchman,
          Razor Jim Donovan, to help me out, but I'm not sure I trust him.

    summary: A young sheriff who is determined to bring law and order to a lawless town.
    description: Wyatt Cooper is a young and handsome man, with a chiseled jaw and piercing green eyes. He stands tall
      and carries himself with an air of confidence that belies his youth. He wears a sheriff's badge on his chest,
      and his gun is always at his side.
    backstory: Wyatt Cooper was born and raised in the west, and he learned from a young age the importance of justice
      and fairness. His father was a rancher until a raid by anonymous soldiers raided their home and burned the ranch,
      forcing his family to move back east in poverty.
      
      Wyatt stayed in hopes of finding those responsible and became the deputy of Thistle Gulch, working under Sheriff
      "Top" Morgan, (Rose's father) who was a respected and beloved lawman. Wyatt followed in his footsteps, until
      Sheriff Morgan was killed in a shootout with bandits last year. Wyatt was appointed to take his place with the
      help of  Mayor Victoria Grant who has become his mentor as of late.
      
      Wyatt quickly learned that being a sheriff in a lawless town was no easy task. The town was overrun with bandits,
      thieves, and outlaws, and the corrupt politicians in charge turned a blind eye to their crimes. Wyatt knew he had
      his work cut out for him.
      
      He fell in love with Rose Morgan the first time he met her, but doesn't feel worthy until he brings her
      father's killers to justice.
